Geo::Address::Mail::Standardizer::USPS - Offline implementation of USPS Postal Addressing Standards

SYNOPSIS

This module provides an offline implementation of the USPS Publication 28 - 
Postal Addressing Standards as defined by http://pe.usps.com/text/pub28/welcome.htm.

    my $std = Geo::Address::Mail::Standardizer::USPS->new;

    my $address = Geo::Address::Mail::US->new(
        name => 'Test Testerson',
        street => '123 Test Street',
        street2 => 'Apartment #2',
        city => 'Testville',
        state => 'TN',
        postal_code => '12345'
    );

    my $res = $std->standardize($address);
    my $corr = $res->standardized_address;

WARNING

This module is not a complete implementation of USPS Publication 28.  It
intends to be, but that will probably take a while.
