NAME
    Geo::Address::Mail::Standardizer::USPS - Offline implementation of USPS
    Postal Addressing Standards

SYNOPSIS
    This module provides an offline implementation of the USPS Publication
    28 - Postal Addressing Standards as defined by
    <http://pe.usps.com/text/pub28/welcome.htm>.

        my $std = Geo::Address::Mail::Standardizer::USPS->new;

        my $address = Geo::Address::Mail::US->new(
            name => 'Test Testerson',
            street => '123 Test Street',
            street2 => 'Apartment #2',
            city => 'Testville',
            state => 'TN',
            postal_code => '12345'
        );

        my $res = $std->standardize($address);
        my $corr = $res->standardized_address;

WARNING
    This module is not a complete implementation of USPS Publication 28. It
    intends to be, but that will probably take a while. In the meantime it
    may be useful for testing or for pseudo-standardizaton.

USPS Postal Address Standards Implemented
    This module currently handles the following sections from Publication
    28:

    *212 Format*
         <http://pe.usps.com/text/pub28/pub28c2_002.htm>

    *213.1 Common Designators*
         <http://pe.usps.com/text/pub28/pub28c2_003.htm>

         <http://pe.usps.com/text/pub28/pub28apc_003.htm#ep538629>

    *222 Punctuation*
         Punctuation is removed from all fields except "postal_code". Note
         that this isn't really kosher when using address ranges...
